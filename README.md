# FL-League-Percentiles

Create Hitter and Pitcher Percentile charts just like baseball savant.

Once you have all the stats you want to add, the rest is fairly straight forward. I'm using 2 different sources: Yakkertech pitch data, and season stats from Presto sports. I won't be providing either csv since it violates the Frontier League / Yakkertech data sharing agreement, but you could probably do this fairly easily with MLB (or other league) data.
